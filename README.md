# BraTS Challenge
This repository contains our implementation of the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 Challenge, recreated as part of a university project. 
The goal was to understand and apply key concepts in medical image segmentation, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
In contrast to the original challenge, our task focused on segmenting the tumor core and edema.

## Implementation
Our model is based on the U-Net architecture.

We implemented a range of techniques to improve model performance.
These include preprocessing the MRI data through normalization and cropping to the region of interest (ROI). 

## Code
All relevant code can be found in the BraTS_PyTorch folder.

## Contributors
This implementation was developed by Sophia Backert, Annika Braun, Gun Marit Ingwersen and Elham Mohammadi (Team B) as part of our university project.

# BraTS-SimpleITK
This repository contains the implementation of our project: brain tumor and edema segmentation using classical image processing techniques with SimpleITK.

The aim was to develop an automatic segmentation method for brain tumors and surrounding edema from clinical MRI data, using traditional image processing approaches.

## Method
We used a combination of preprocessing, image enhancement, and classical segmentation methods to identify and extract tumor and edema regions from MRI scans.

## Code
All relevant scripts can be found in the BraTS-SimpleITK folder.
Please refer to the respective Python files for implementation details and usage instructions.
